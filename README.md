# Church Family Records DBMS project
In church governance, a diocese or bishopric is the ecclesiastical district under the jurisdiction of a bishop. The Diocese of Belgaum has a total of 67 parishes spread over various districts including Belgaum, and each of these parishes are divided into many zones for easier administration. One of the major reasons for dividing the area into zones is to record the family data of all the families belonging to a parish. 

Earlier these records were entered and maintained in physical books and ledgers, but its difficult to maintain these records at a high level. As these need to be updated at regular intervals and a require a huge database, it was necessary to implement software solutions to make this job easier. Our project aims at storing the records of all the families belonging to a zone, and further recording the zonal details of each church. Our project provides an easy method for the users to submit their details to be recorded into the database, and also an easier way to view to details of fellow parishioners.
